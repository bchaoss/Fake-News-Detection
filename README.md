# Fake-News-Detection
- RNN model in tensorflow
- LSTM model in tensorflow
- Bert-base model after fine-tuning
- Python script for building web app

The focus of this project is to develop a news authenticity detection system. Models including RNN and LSTM were built using `TensorFlow` to analyze and classify the authenticity of news articles. Another model was fine-tuned from a pre-trained BERT model in `Pythorch`. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data) consists of more than 22,000+ news articles that underwent preprocessing steps such as removing stop words, tokenization, vectorization, and sequence padding/truncation. The models were then deployed as a user-friendly web app using `Gradio`, allowing users to input news articles and receive real-time authenticity predictions. By combining state-of-the-art modeling, meticulous data processing, and seamless deployment, this project aims to provide an efficient tool for identifying the authenticity of news articles.
